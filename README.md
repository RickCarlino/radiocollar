radiocollar
===========
A way to track your GPS location using HTML5 geolocation. [Live demo is up on Heroku](http://radiocollar.herokuapp.com/)

Sending your location
=====================
1. Type a name for your waypoint
2. submit

Viewing someone elses location
==============================
1. Enter the waypoint into the form
2. submit

_OR_

1. Go to radiocollar.herokuapp.com/p/[NAME OF THE WAYPOINT]

Need a _real_ location naming service?
====================================

If you like the service and would like to use an _actual_ location naming service, I recomend using [Naymit](www.naymit.com). This application is currently in Alpha phase and is mostly intended to be used as an example for programmers who are trying to manipulate geodata.
